    I ended up skimming a paper that explained the reduction in computer science during the period of 2004 - 2010.  The dot com bubble accounts for the last peak around 2001.  Outsourcing may have played a big role in decline of enrollment in 2004.  Outsourcing involves people losing local jobs which may give the impression that employment opportunities are limited.  There is also cyclical downturn.  Demand at certain times increase demand for other products and services while decreasing others.  Slow job growth during the early 2000s set up the decline as well.
  </p>

  <p>
  Some of the growth in computer science enrollment may be from the strong job market in technology fields and the fact that the overall economy is probably weak.  The starting pay in computer science is high and that always attracts some people.  Technology has become very popular so the fact that people are mere users may have inspired them to understand how technology works.  Computer Science may not have as much of the negative stigma that it is a solitary profession as it used to have as the subject may be becoming more mainstream.
